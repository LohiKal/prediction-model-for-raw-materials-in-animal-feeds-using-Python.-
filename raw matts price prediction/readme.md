To run this Python code on your local Windows machine, you can follow these general steps:

Install Python: If you haven't already installed Python, you can download and install the latest version from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/. Make sure to select the appropriate version for your operating system (e.g., Windows).

Install required libraries: In this code, we use several Python libraries, including pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn. You can install these libraries using the pip package manager by running the following commands in a command prompt or terminal:
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install scikit-learn


Download the data file: Make sure you have downloaded the "animal_feeds_ph.csv" data file to the same directory as your Python code.

Run the code: Open a command prompt or terminal, navigate to the directory where your Python code and data file are located, and run the Python script using the following command:

python animal_feeds_prediction.py
This assumes that your Python script is named "animal_feeds_prediction.py". If your script has a different name, replace it with the correct name in the command above.

Interpret the results: Once the code has finished running, it should display the root mean squared error (RMSE) value. You can interpret this value as a measure of how well the model predicts the crude protein content of the animal feed based on the raw material percentages. The lower the RMSE, the better the model performs.
